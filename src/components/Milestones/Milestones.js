              What did you study this weekend? This week was a long weekend in
              Vancouver, so before having a good time with my people, I’ve
              continued to build up my porfolio website. Evne there was no any
              complex algorithm to build, but still I’m poor at the css sytyls,
              it tooks more time than I expected.
